# React two way select

A simple proof of concept for a two steps form side-by-side where choices made in either step exclude the possible options in the the other step.

The problem space is basically that we are not sure which step is the most crucial to the "customer": Does time trumph service availability or vice versa? Having selections made in a previous step invalidated by a later step in a stepping form is infuriating, however showing only a selection of options based a previous choice forces the user to go back and fourth in order to get a complete idea of what's on offer. This approach would be a possible to solution to this problem.

This idea could be applied to booking of cinema tickets where for example some customers care the most about when they're going to see the moive whilst other users care more about seat positioning.
